    Touhou Project

    Hello
    The Touhou Project (東方Project,
    Tōhō Purojekuto, lit. Eastern Project)
    , also known as Toho Project or
    Project Shrine Maiden,
    is a Japanese dōjin game series
    focused on bullet hell shooters
    made by the one-man developer
    Team Shanghai Alice, whose sole member,
    known as ZUN, is responsible for all
    the graphics, music, and programming
    for the most part. The series was inducted
    into the Guinness World Records in October 2010
    for being the "most prolific fan-made shooter series".
    The "Touhou Project" began in 1995 when "Highly
    Responsive to Prayers" was first developed by
    the group Amusement Makers for the Japanese NEC PC-9801
    series of computers; the game was later released in
    November 1996. The next four "Touhou" games released between
    August 1997 and December 1998 also were released on the NEC PC-9801
    . The "Touhou Project" was inactive for the next three and half
    years until the first Microsoft Windows "Touhou" game,
    "The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil", was released in August
    2002 solely by ZUN after he split from Amusement Makers
    and started Team Shanghai Alice. The "Touhou Project"
    became a media franchise spanning a steadily increasing
    number of official games, in addition to commercial fan books
    , music, light novels, and manga.
